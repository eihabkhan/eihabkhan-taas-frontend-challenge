## The Idea ðŸ’¡

Sync your GitHub account to view all your repos and their commit history

As part of this coding challenge I want to give a name to the app I'm required to build, I'm going for something simple, I'm callying it "Commitly"

## The Process ðŸ”„

I want to shift the prespective and look at this coding challenge as a **Product** rather than a repository, so I'll take time to design AND code the app properly.

### Design

I want to start off with the design, which is not complicated given that the app idea is fairly simple; connect your account -> view your repos -> view the commit history of an individual repo.

You can view the Figma design file [HERE](https://www.figma.com/file/09WnHXqHYGwwudNWfa2QZh/Commitly?type=design&node-id=1%3A5&mode=design&t=ESqPptU2sXbH91jv-1)

### Code

I will be using Vue.js for this app, I used Vue.js before but only to manage a few forms, so building an app for the first time in Vue is exciting for me.
